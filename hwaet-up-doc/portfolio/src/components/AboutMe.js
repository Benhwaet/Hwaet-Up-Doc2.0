                    As a Library Assistant, Ben spends his days preparing storytimes and crafts for children, 
                    and engaging in other exciting library tasks.
                    He is a big fan of video games, scifi-fantasy novels and interactive fiction, as well as 
                    books in general. 
                    Since videogames and library databases fill up much of his life, he thought coding would 
                    be a way to not only understand these things better, but also build and/or modify them.
                    Having grown up in the 90s and remembering the fun days of dial-up internet and phones with cords, 
                    seeing technology grow at an exponential rate has been a fascinating experience. He would like to 
                    understand <strong>some</strong> of this technology more deeply.
                    Comfortable with technology and the intenet (though not social media), 
                    Ben is very much a beginner in terms of coding. He also doesn't speak in the third person 
                    in real life.<strong id="welcome">Welcome to my first website, it probably shows.</strong>
